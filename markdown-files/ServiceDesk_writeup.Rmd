## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(chat$ChatDuration)
```
```{r}
ggp_all <- (chatD_graph0 + Wait_time_graph2a) / (Chat_ab_graph0 + CreatedDate_graph0) +    # Create grid of plots with title
  plot_annotation(title = "Overview of Service Desk Requests via Chat", subtitle = "outliers removed") 

ggp_all  
```


```{r}
chat %>%
  group_by(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Mean = mean(ChatDuration, na.rm=TRUE)/60) # full data
```
This is in minutes now.
```{r}
chatD_graph <- ggplot(chatD_out, aes(x = LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName, y = durationMinutes1, fill = LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  ylim(0, 35) +
  labs(x="Unit", y="Minutes") +
  scale_x_discrete(guide = guide_axis(n.dodge=2))+
  theme(legend.position="none") 

chatD_graph <- chatD_graph + labs(title = "Chat Duration", 
                                          subtitle = "outliers removed")
print(chatD_graph)

```
Below is data with the outliers removed. 
```{r}
 chatD_out %>%
  group_by(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Mean = mean(ChatDuration, na.rm=TRUE)/60)
```

```{r}
chat %>%
  group_by(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Ave_wait = mean(WaitTime, na.rm=TRUE)/60)
```
This is a graph of Wait time. This is for everyone. 
```{r}
chat_wait_out %>%
  group_by(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Ave_wait = mean(WaitTime, na.rm=TRUE)/60)
```

## Abandoned chats
```{r}
chat %>%
  group_by(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Ave_abandon = mean(Abandoned, na.rm = TRUE))
```
Below are data with the removal of outliers. 
```{r}
chatAb_out %>% 
  group_by(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Ave_abandon = mean(Abandoned, na.rm = TRUE))
```
This is the cat time of day. 
```{r}
chatTime = filter1(chat$CreatedDate)
chats %>%
  group_by(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Ave_hour = mean(chatTime, na.rm = TRUE))
```
```
This is with outliers removed. 
```{r}
CreatedDate_out2 = dplyr::mutate(CreatedDate_out, created_hour = filter1(CreatedDate_out$CreatedDate))
CreatedDate_out2 %>%
  group_by(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Ave_hour1 = mean(created_hour, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
DeployGraph2 <- chat %>%
  # drop_na(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName, fill = LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName, response = Status)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Units", y = "Number of Chats")

DeployGraph2 <- DeployGraph2 + labs(title = "Number of Chats across Units", 
                                    subtitle = "",  fill = "Live Chat Developer") 

print(DeployGraph2)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.

Chat time of time
```{r}
chats = dplyr::mutate(chat, chatTime = filter(chat$CreatedDate))
Unit_ToD <- ggplot(chats, aes(x = LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName, 
                              y = chatTime, fill = LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName)) +
  geom_boxplot() +
  # ggtitle("Unit Chat Time of Day") +
  ylim(0, 24) +
  ylab("Chat Time of Day") +
  xlab("Unit Name")

Unit_ToD <- Unit_ToD + labs(title = "Unit Chat Time of Day", 
                            subtitle = ,  fill = "Live Chat Developer")
print(Unit_ToD)
```
