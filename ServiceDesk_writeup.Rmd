## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r}
summary(chat$ChatDuration)
```


```{r}
chat %>%
  group_by(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Mean = mean(ChatDuration, na.rm=TRUE)/60)
```
This is in minutes now.

```{r}
chat %>%
  group_by(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>%
  dplyr::summarize(Ave_wait = mean(WaitTime, na.rm=TRUE)/60)
```

## Abandoned chats
```{r}
chat %>%
  group_by(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Ave_abandon = mean(Abandoned, na.rm = TRUE))
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r}
DeployGraph2 <- chat %>%
  # drop_na(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x = LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName, fill = LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName, response = Status)) +
  geom_bar() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(x = "Units", y = "Number of Chats")

DeployGraph2 <- DeployGraph2 + labs(title = "Number of Chats across Units", 
                                    subtitle = "",  fill = "Live Chat Developer") 

print(DeployGraph2)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
```{r}
chats %>%
  group_by(LiveChatDeployment.DeveloperName) %>%
  dplyr::summarise(Ave_hour = mean(chatTime, na.rm = TRUE))
```
